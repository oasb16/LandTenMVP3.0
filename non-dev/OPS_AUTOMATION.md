# Operations & Automation

## Automated Steps
- AWS CLI scripts for EC2, ECR, security groups, key pairs.
- Docker image build/push/pull for backend.
- .env file management for secrets/config.

## Monitoring & Recovery
- Log all errors, never halt on failure.
- Recursively iterate fixes until all services are functional.
- Use breadth-first approach for infra and code issues.
